This code is an 2 dimensional adaptation from the 1D code posted by Richard Fitzpatrick in the course "Computational Physics" from the Texas University. the results are the Two stream instability for both dimensions. this code keeps the normalization scheme stablished in the 1D code, but using a different discretization method for Poisson solver. FFTW library is used to calculate fast Fourier transform required to solve the Poisson Equations.
